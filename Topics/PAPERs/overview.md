# IoT Standards and Protocols

## Protocols
```
https://www.postscapes.com/internet-of-things-protocols/
Rather than trying to fit all of the IoT Protocols on top of existing architecture models like OSI Model, 
we have broken the protocols into the following layers to provide some level of organization:

Infrastructure (ex: 6LowPAN, IPv4/IPv6, RPL)
Identification (ex: EPC, uCode, IPv6, URIs)
Comms / Transport (ex: Wifi, Bluetooth, LPWAN)
Discovery (ex: Physical Web, mDNS, DNS-SD)
Data Protocols (ex: MQTT, CoAP, AMQP, Websocket, Node)
Device Management (ex: TR-069, OMA-DM)
Semantic (ex: JSON-LD, Web Thing Model)
Multi-layer Frameworks (ex: Alljoyn, IoTivity, Weave, Homekit)

Security
Industry Vertical (Connected Home, Industrial, etc)
